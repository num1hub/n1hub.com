Title: Modern Web Development Practices

Modern web development involves building responsive, performant applications using current best practices and tools. The ecosystem has evolved significantly with frameworks, build tools, and deployment platforms.

Frontend development focuses on user interface and experience. React, Vue, and Angular are popular frameworks that enable component-based architectures. TypeScript adds type safety to JavaScript, reducing bugs and improving developer experience. CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS provide utility-first styling approaches.

Backend development handles server logic, databases, and APIs. Node.js enables JavaScript on the server, while Python frameworks like FastAPI and Django provide robust API development. RESTful APIs remain standard, with GraphQL offering flexible querying. Microservices architectures break applications into independent, scalable services.

Database choices include relational databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL) for structured data and NoSQL databases (MongoDB, Redis) for flexible schemas and caching. ORMs like Prisma and SQLAlchemy simplify database interactions.

DevOps practices include continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), containerization with Docker, and orchestration with Kubernetes. Cloud platforms like Vercel, Railway, and AWS provide scalable hosting solutions.

Performance optimization involves code splitting, lazy loading, caching strategies, and CDN usage. Security considerations include authentication, authorization, input validation, and protection against common vulnerabilities like XSS and SQL injection.

Testing strategies encompass unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests. Tools like Jest, Vitest, and Playwright facilitate comprehensive test coverage.
