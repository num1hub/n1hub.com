Title: Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. The core idea is to build algorithms that can identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions based on those patterns.

There are three main types of machine learning:

1. Supervised Learning: Uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Examples include classification (predicting categories) and regression (predicting numerical values). Common algorithms include linear regression, decision trees, and neural networks.

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Clustering groups similar data points together, while dimensionality reduction simplifies data while preserving important information. K-means clustering and principal component analysis are popular techniques.

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learns through trial and error by interacting with an environment. The agent receives rewards or penalties for actions and learns to maximize cumulative reward over time. This approach powers game-playing AI and robotics.

Key concepts include feature engineering (selecting and transforming input variables), model training (adjusting parameters to minimize error), validation (testing on unseen data), and deployment (using models in production).

The machine learning workflow typically involves: data collection and cleaning, feature selection, model selection, training, validation, and iteration to improve performance.
